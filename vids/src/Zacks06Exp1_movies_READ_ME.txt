Movies

This DVD contains four movies from our laboratory's research on event perception. We have used three of them as experimental stimuli, with the four used as a practice movie. The movies are shown at a resolution of 320x240 pixels (compressed to optimize playback at this size), but they can be scaled if needed. Titles and brief descriptions of the movies are listed below.
